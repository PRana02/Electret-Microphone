I am trying to implement Alexa skills on the phone without using raspberry Pi at the moment.
Below is the link that shows how to implement the alexa on the android or ios platform.

https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/reference-implementation-guide

This is the reference provided by the amazon to implement alexa skills on the android and IOS platform.

We have to download Apache Maven and Node.js server.

To implement on the phone, I have created one more product on amazon developer account that supports android application and not the actual device like Raspberry pi.
