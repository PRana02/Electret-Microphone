* Created blog link from the [Repository](https://prana02.github.io/Wireless-Microphone/) that includes all the progress throughtout with some images.

## Week 5  -  November 27 2017 (Post Strike)
* I showed acquisition of my parts and Raspberry Pi working successfully.
* Due to strike, we didnt have much to submit in the first week.

## Strike Days (During college's strike)
* During strike, I watched few videos of [ Setting-Up Raspberry Pi ](https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html) and softwares that were needed to be installed on it.
* I got my parts within 2 weeks and I started working on setting up the Raspberry Pi and installing [raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on it.
* I sent gerber files to our Technical Department to print the PCB board.
* Once PCB board arrived, I soldered it with the help of a technician and got the LED blinked.
* In addidtion to blinked LED, I also attached Humidity,Temperature and Light sensors which we got with our PCB board.

## Week 4  -  October 02 2017
* By this week I needed to hand in my [Budget](https://github.com/PRana02/Wireless-Microphone/blob/master/FINAL%20bUDGET.xlsx) Report.
