## Piyush Rana CENG 317 USB Microphone -- Blog.

## Week 7  -  December 04 2017
* So far, I have worked on my sensor and created account on amazon developer to use alexa skills for my sensor.
* I created group placacrd with my team-mates

** Below is the script of the 30 seconds video:
* <i>For first few seconds, I am showing my name and project name along with the parts arrival.</i>
* For next few seconds, I am connecting my sensor and Speakers to the Raspberry Pi.
* Then comes the registration of amazon developer account and the steps followed to install Alexa skills on the Raspberry Pi.
* Further comes the execution of the scripts (Alexa Skills) on Raspberry Pi and connecting it to my USB microphone.
* Finally, I can hear responses through the speakers when I ask or say something.



## Week 6  -  December 04 2017
* Due to some circuit problem in my PCB board, I had to change some connections so I took help from our prototype lab.
* My professor provided the new circuit diagram for the PCB and a python script that I used to run those sensors.
* I added python script to detect humidity sensor

* I am still left to run hardware clock.
* My professor suggested me to take out two of three sensors to detect hardware clock and I saw some changes in the connection on screen afterwards.
* I researched about it on the internet and solutions were like to making some changes in /etc/boot and etc/services files. But it wasn't effective.
* I showed all the sensors(Humidity,Temperature and Light) working with LED blinking on PCB board.

* Created blog link from the [Repository](https://prana02.github.io/Wireless-Microphone/) that includes all the progress throughtout with some images.

## Week 5  -  November 27 2017 (Post Strike)
* I showed acquisition of my parts and Raspberry Pi working successfully.
* Due to strike, we didnt have much to submit in the first week. 

## Strike Days (During college's strike)
* During strike, I watched few videos of [ Setting-Up Raspberry Pi ](https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html) and softwares that were needed to be installed on it.
* I got my parts within 2 weeks and I started working on setting up the Raspberry Pi and installing [raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on it.
* I sent gerber files to our Technical Department to print the PCB board.
* Once PCB board arrived, I soldered it with the help of a technician and got the LED blinked.
* In addidtion to blinked LED, I also attached Humidity,Temperature and Light sensors which we got with our PCB board.

## Week 4  -  October 02 2017
* By this week I needed to hand in my [Budget](https://github.com/PRana02/Wireless-Microphone/blob/master/FINAL%20bUDGET.xlsx) Report.
* I got back my evaluated GANTT chart back.
* I already ordered some of my parts and need approval of some other parts.

## Week 3  -  September 25 2017
* I handed in my [GANTT](https://github.com/PRana02/Wireless-Microphone/blob/master/PiyushRana.mpp) chart
* I got back my evaluated proposal.
* I reviewed [Learning Markdown on Lynda.com] (https://www.lynda.com/Web-Development-tutorials/Up-Running-Markdown/438888-2.html)

## Week 2  -  September 18 2017
* I handed in a [Proposal](https://github.com/PRana02/Wireless-Microphone/blob/master/ProposalContent.xlsx).
* I watched some [soldering videos] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY&list=PLQ32vZrF5U2lFOJTtZDytBWBYVLNp4RYz).

## Week 1  -  September 11 2017
* We were given the list of choices among sensors.
* I chose [SunFounder USB 2.0 Mini Microphone.](https://www.amazon.ca/SunFounder-Microphone-Raspberry-Recognition-Software/dp/B01KLRBHGM/).

## Week 0  -  September 05 2017  
* Hola - welcome to USB Wireless Microphone Repository.
* In first week, I did a tech quiz and created my [repository](https://github.com/PRana02/Wireless-Microphone).
